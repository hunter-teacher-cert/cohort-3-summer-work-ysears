CODE TRACING in the classroom
======================================


PROS:
---------------------------------------
<general positive aspects of incorporating code or algorithm tracing into a CS course, from your perspective>

- It allows us to undestand how the computer is going to process the algorithm.
- Helps break down the steps, so that you can understand better what is happening in the code
- Helps you plan and diagram how you want to write your code
- Helps you debug and identify where the error might be.
- Helps teachers assess students' understanding of the code and computational thinking.
- Verbalize thought process


CONS:
---------------------------------------
<general negative aspects of incorporating code or algorithm tracing into a CS course, from your perspective>
- Different groups of people need different amounts of time.
- If it's too slow, some people will check out
- If it's too fast, some people will be lost from the diagrams and feel less confident in attempting the task
- Challenging when you don't know how to visualize or put to pen vague thoughts in the brain




BEST FOR:
---------------------------------------
<types of activities from courses you teach or have taught that could benefit from an emphasis on tracing>
- for or while loops
- Recursions
- When variables change values

LEAST-SUITED TO:
---------------------------------------
<opposite of above -- and why>
- If there are too many methods in the main method 

PROVEN PRO-TIPS:
---------------------------------------
<
 anything that has worked well for any member of your team, in the way of ...
 * live tracing ("trace-along" a la livecoding)
 * tracing as an assignment
 * tools, physical/online/otherwise that make it easier/clearer
 * etc 
>
- Colors!!
- Physical whiteboards or a highly functioning collaborative e-whiteboard
- Having the code there too for easy access and annotatability
- Show different templates of various types of diagrams (choose from menu which is the best diagram)
