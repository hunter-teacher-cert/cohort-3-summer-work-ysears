# Physical Sorting Algorithms 

### Background
This activity will help them consider sorting algorithms that compare to values (physical objects) at a time.  Eventually leading to discussing algorithmic efficiency. 


### Participant pre-requisites
anything students should already know to make this work well
optionally with some treatment of how necessary each pre-req is...
-- Have an understanding of list and indexes
-- Have an understanding of Loops

### Scaffolding / Differentiation 
* an aspect of this activity well-suited to tiering / scaffolding / differentiation
* a grouping suggestion -- groups of 4
* Students will be able to choose how they want to measure their items (balance, ruler, etc.)(needs to be a quantity!)
* Checklist (notes?) for students to write out the results of their comparisons (Item A vs. Item B --> which one was more)
* Students can create diagrams before writing algorithm
 
### Go!
1. Give groups a set of objects with a variety of weights and a balance scale as well as a table to record each comaprison using the scales.  
1. Show students how to log each comparison they make on the scale into the table.  ex) 1:  Object A > Object C ...
1. Give groups time to sort the objects, comparing 2 at a time and recording their trials in the table.  
1. Prompt students to give a detailed explanation of the process they used to sort the ojects (their algorithm.)
1. Whole class discussion on what strategies/algorithms each group used; which sorted them most "efficiently"?
