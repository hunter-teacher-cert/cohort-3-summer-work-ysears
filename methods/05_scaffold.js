// Scaffold -- Provide students with vocabulary and skeleton to have them practice printing the length and first characters of strings. 

// Students instructions (Provided for Students):
// The characters in a string each have an index.

// string.length returns the length of a string
// string.substring(start,end) returns a portion of the string, beginning at the start index and ending with the letter before the end index.

// Do This
// 1) Run the code to see how these two new commands work
// 2) Follow the pattern in the starter code to print the name, length, and first character of the longest country and city name in the console.

console.log("The longest animal name is " + longestAnimal);
console.log("It has " + longestAnimal.length + " characters");
console.log("Its first letter is " + longestAnimal.substring(0,1));

// Print the name, length, and first letter of the longestCountry
