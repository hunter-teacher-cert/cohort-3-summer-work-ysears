### Technique: Heterogeneous Grouping 

#### Well-suited to...
* Driver navigator pair programming
* Tracing Code
* Project Based Assessment

#### Example
* Tracing through pseudocode
* Pair Programing -- Bar Graph example
* Provide sentence starters to ensure productive conversations between students


* * *
### Technique: Leveled Coding Tasks

#### Well-suited to...
* Independent work
* Pair Programming
* Any multi step project!
* Self assessment of a particular topic

#### Example
* Labeling methods to be written by difficulty
* In a code skeleton, putting the methods in order of difficulty
* In a coding project, having the parts of the project labeled; extension options to go above and beyond

* * *
### Technique: Cheat Sheet/Code Examples

#### Well-suited to...
* When working on new topics.
* As a review for topics that have not been covered in a while.
* When syntax is tricky. 
* When students are ready to go ahead to more advanced topics.
* Students that missed a class, or cannot find their examples or notes from previous lessons.

#### Example
* Giving students a list of methods that can be called by ArrayLists,  (the arraylists cheatsheet)
* Giving students a fully functional code that shows the syntax for a new concept that they will then create a realted program for.  
* Give them a clear example of the exact syntax needed, for example all of the puctiation involved in a for-loop.
* Give them links to documentation for a library or method. 
  

* * *
### Technique: provide defined methods /tools (return type, parameter,etc)  

#### Well-suited to...
* divide a big task into smaller tasks
* demonstrate the connections of the methods(tools)
* other thing

#### Example
* Sorting and BinarySearch
* sorting (unplugged)
* Given the names and the parameters of the methods
* Provide the explanation of the functionality of the method   
  

* * *
### Technique: COMMENTING

#### Well-suited to...
* Assuming the students received a skeleton of the coding assignment, 
  provide students with comments throughout the code with scaffolded 
  suggestions or considerations, instructions, hints etcâ€¦
* 
* 

#### Example
* Any programming assignment where students have to write code
* 
*
