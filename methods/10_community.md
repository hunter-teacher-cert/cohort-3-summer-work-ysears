###  Spaghetti Tower Activity
#### How It Works
Blah blah...
* detail
* specific
* etc

more prose...
1. ordered
1. list
1. of steps...


#### Expected Positive Outcomes
This is attractive because...
* it is an accessible activity that helps to begin building community amongst the students. (We are all on the same team!)
* it allows students to feel as if they have something to contribute, coming into a class they already have pre-conceived notions about (AP and CS = too hard for them)


#### Rollout Timeline
* This is typically a one period activity, done in the first two weeks of school.
* Significant milestones along the way?

#### Mechanism for Gauging Efficacy
How will you know it is working?

#### Expected Hurdles and Plans to Overcome
* ( if any... )

###  Ask 3 Before Me!

#### How It Works
* When working on various tasks, students are required to consult their classmates for assistance BEFORE asking me.
* They have to ask at LEAST 3 other people in the class. If no one can answer their question, then I can interject. 
* If no one can answer their questions, it usually means we need to come back together as a class to clarify something.

1. If a student is confused about something, they can ask a classmate for assistance.
2. If the classmate who was asked doesn't know, said student can ask another classmate.
3. Repeat once more. Then consult instructor.


#### Expected Positive Outcomes
This is attractive because...
* it forces the students to build a repoire with each other
* it allows students the freedom to make mistakes and self correct!


#### Rollout Timeline
* This rolls out at the very beginning of the year. However, this routine takes time to run seamlessly
* Significant milestones along the way?

#### Mechanism for Gauging Efficacy
How will you know it is working?

#### Expected Hurdles and Plans to Overcome
* ( if any... )
