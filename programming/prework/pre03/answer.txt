When ping is invoked, it prints a period and goes to the next line.
When baffle is invoked, it prints "wug". Ping is then invoked and it prints a period and goes to the next line. 

Overall output of the program is:
No, I wug.
You wugga wug.
I wug.
The cursor ends on the next line.

Q2: I was a little confused by this but I think this is the answer:
main-zoop
zoop-baffle
baffle-ping
ping - "."


Q3: If you invoke baffle(); at the end of the ping method, it would call both methods indefinitely.
